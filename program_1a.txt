1. a)

Consider the Sailor database given below. The primary keys are underlined.
Assume relevant data types for attributes.
SAILORS(Sid, Sname, Rating, Age)
BOATS(Bid, Bname, Colour)
RESERVES(Sid, Bid, day)
Create the above tables in SQL. Specify primary and foreign keys properly.
Enter at least 5 tuples in each table with relevant data. Solve the following
queries.
i. Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least one boat.
ii. Find the Sid’s of sailors who have reserved a red or a green boat.
iii. Find the Sid’s of sailors who have not reserved a boat


-- Creating the tables
CREATE TABLE SAILORS(
    Sid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Sname VARCHAR(100),
    Rating INT,
    Age INT
);

CREATE TABLE BOATS(
    Bid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Bname VARCHAR(100),
    Colour VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE RESERVES(
    Sid INT,
    Bid INT,
    day DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (Sid, Bid, day),
    FOREIGN KEY (Sid) REFERENCES SAILORS(Sid),
    FOREIGN KEY (Bid) REFERENCES BOATS(Bid)
);

-- Inserting data into the tables
INSERT INTO SAILORS VALUES (1, 'Jack', 5, 35), (2, 'John', 4, 40), (3, 'Jill', 3, 25), (4, 'James', 2, 30), (5, 'Julia', 1, 20);
INSERT INTO BOATS VALUES (1, 'Boat1', 'Red'), (2, 'Boat2', 'Green'), (3, 'Boat3', 'Blue'), (4, 'Boat4', 'Yellow'), (5, 'Boat5', 'White');
INSERT INTO RESERVES VALUES (1, 1, '2024-02-20'), (2, 2, '2024-02-21'), (3, 3, '2024-02-22'), (4, 4, '2024-02-23'), (5, 5, '2024-02-24');

-- Queries
-- i. Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least one boat.
SELECT Sname FROM SAILORS WHERE Sid IN (SELECT Sid FROM RESERVES);

-- ii. Find the Sid’s of sailors who have reserved a red or a green boat.
SELECT Sid FROM RESERVES WHERE Bid IN (SELECT Bid FROM BOATS WHERE Colour IN ('Red', 'Green'));

-- iii. Find the Sid’s of sailors who have not reserved a boat.
SELECT Sid FROM SAILORS WHERE Sid NOT IN (SELECT Sid FROM RESERVES);
