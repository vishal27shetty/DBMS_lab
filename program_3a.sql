--Consider the Aircraft database given below. The primary keys are

--AIRCRAFT (Aircraft ID, Aircraft_name, Cruising_range)
--CERTIFIED (Emp ID, Aircraft ID)
--EMPLOYEE (Emp ID, Ename, Salary)
--Create the above tables in SQL. Specify primary and foreign keys properly.
--Enter at least 5 tuples in each table with relevant data. Solve the following
