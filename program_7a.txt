Consider the following Accident Tracker Schema. The primary keys are

underlined.
PERSON (driver – id #, name, address)
CAR (Regno, model, year)
ACCIDENT (report-number, acc_date, location)
OWNS (driver-id #, Regno)
PARTICIPATED (driver-id, Regno, report-number, damageamount)
Create the above tables in SQL. Specify primary and foreign keys properly.
Enter at least 5 tuples in each table with relevant data. Solve the following
queries.
i. Display the unique Regno’s of the cars involved in accidents.
ii. Display the car Regno and model of the car which has the maximum
damage amount.
iii. Display the number of cars owned by each driver.

-- Create PERSON Table
CREATE TABLE PERSON (
    driver_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(200)
);

-- Insert sample data into PERSON
INSERT INTO PERSON (driver_id, name, address)
VALUES
    (1, 'John Doe', '123 Main St, City A'),
    (2, 'Jane Smith', '456 Elm St, City B');

-- Create CAR Table
CREATE TABLE CAR (
    Regno VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    model VARCHAR(50),
    year INT
);

-- Insert sample data into CAR
INSERT INTO CAR (Regno, model, year)
VALUES
    ('ABC123', 'Toyota', 2018),
    ('XYZ789', 'Honda', 2020);

-- Create ACCIDENT Table
CREATE TABLE ACCIDENT (
    report_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
    acc_date DATE,
    location VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into ACCIDENT
INSERT INTO ACCIDENT (report_number, acc_date, location)
VALUES
    (101, '2024-03-01', 'Intersection A'),
    (102, '2024-03-02', 'Highway B');

-- Create OWNS Table
CREATE TABLE OWNS (
    driver_id INT,
    Regno VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (driver_id, Regno),
    FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES PERSON(driver_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Regno) REFERENCES CAR(Regno)
);

-- Insert sample data into OWNS
INSERT INTO OWNS (driver_id, Regno)
VALUES
    (1, 'ABC123'),
    (2, 'XYZ789');

-- Create PARTICIPATED Table
CREATE TABLE PARTICIPATED (
    driver_id INT,
    Regno VARCHAR(10),
    report_number INT,
    damageamount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (driver_id, Regno, report_number),
    FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES PERSON(driver_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (Regno) REFERENCES CAR(Regno),
    FOREIGN KEY (report_number) REFERENCES ACCIDENT(report_number)
);

-- Insert sample data into PARTICIPATED
INSERT INTO PARTICIPATED (driver_id, Regno, report_number, damageamount)
VALUES
    (1, 'ABC123', 101, 500.00),
    (2, 'XYZ789', 102, 1000.00);

-- Queries:

-- i. Unique Regno's of cars involved in accidents
SELECT DISTINCT Regno
FROM PARTICIPATED;

-- ii. Car Regno and model with maximum damage amount
SELECT p.Regno, c.model
FROM PARTICIPATED p
JOIN CAR c ON p.Regno = c.Regno
WHERE p.damageamount = (SELECT MAX(damageamount) FROM PARTICIPATED);

-- iii. Number of cars owned by each driver
SELECT o.driver_id, COUNT(o.Regno) AS num_owned_cars
FROM OWNS o
GROUP BY o.driver_id;
